This policy gives you full unlimited coverage from day one. Everything is covered — including dental, pregnancy, and even cosmetic surgery. There are no room rent restrictions, and you don’t have to pay anything at the time of claim. You can even use it for small illnesses like fever or cough.

It also comes with cashless coverage at any hospital you like and a free health checkup every year.
